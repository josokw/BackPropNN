# Back Propagation Neural Network

The goal of any **supervised learning algorithm** is to find a function that best maps a set of inputs to their correct output. The motivation for backpropagation is to train a multi-layered neural network such that it can learn the appropriate internal representations to allow it to learn any arbitrary mapping of input to output. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation).

Goal: refactoring example code to modern C++.

- [Background information:](https://missinglink.ai/guides/neural-network-concepts/complete-guide-artificial-neural-networks/)
  
  - **Neuron/perceptron**: the basic unit of the neural network. Accepts an input and generates a prediction. Neural networks generate their predictions in the form of a set of real values or boolean decisions. Each output value is generated by one of the neurons in the output layer.

  - **Activation function**: non-linear **Hyperbolic Tangent**, zero centered making it easier to model inputs that have strongly negative, neutral, and strongly positive values. [Seven types of activation functions](https://missinglink.ai/guides/neural-network-concepts/7-types-neural-network-activation-functions-right/).

## Compiling

The C++ code is compilable by **g++ v9.3.0**.

Go to the *src* directory and type:

```bash
make
```

## Running: training a BackProp NN

A set of inputs for which the correct outputs are known, used to train the neural network.

Run the code for training a backprop NN:

```bash
./backpropnn ../data/XOR/txor.txt 
```
